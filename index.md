### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.
* Lab 1 

    Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs becuase it was putting the subjects 
    that we learned in class with how to run the code and complie it. It really
    started with I became more invested in wanting to know more about how the complier 
    works and what to learn next

* Lab 9
    
    Lab 9, part 1 was one that was quite fun in my opinion. It was the lab where we had elements
    we had done a lab before with elements but I was somewhat confused and needed help. For this lab 
    I wanted to come up with the code by myself. I did it with my partner and I felt a great sense of 
    aheivement went the code worked.
