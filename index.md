### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

   Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I had created a BlackJack game before in python
   however C++ was a different language. My code in python was very messy and didn't have
   the different files that we had today. It was quite fun to code and work though the errors
   that I had received. It taught us how to write functions where we had to convert the face cards
   into numbers.
  
* Lab 1

   Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs because it was putting the subjects
   that we learned in class how to run the code and compile it. It really
   started with I became more invested in wanting to know more about how the compiler
   works and what to learn next.

* Lab 9
  
   Lab 9, part 1 was one that was quite fun in my opinion. It was the lab where we had elements
   We had done a lab before with elements but I was somewhat confused and needed help. For this lab
   I wanted to come up with the code by myself. I did it with my partner and I felt a great sense of
   achievement went the code worked.
